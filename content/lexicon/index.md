Words have meaning. It sounds obvious, but all too often it's easy to find ourselves debating someone without first
confirming that everyone is talking about the same thing. When I communicate, I like to use very specific and
well-defined terms unambiguously. This lexicon serves as a quick reference to the definitions shared across all posts on
this site.

I make no assertion that these definitions are universal!

## System

A `system` takes its definition from Donella Meadows' [Thinking in Systems](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/3828902):

> A system is an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something (function
> or purpose)

Critically, this definition does not restrict use of `system` to a _technical_ system. I will often refer to company
processes, team dynamics, etc. as systems.
