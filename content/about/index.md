# Background

Hi there! My name is Jordan Kaye, currently the Head of Technology for [Belvedere
Trading](http://www.belvederetrading.com)'s office in Boulder. My organization is focused on the research and
development of fully automated low-latency trading systems.

As a leader, I believe that maintaining trust through honesty and consistent expectations is key to building
high-performing teams and organizations.

As a technologist, I enjoy exploring different programming languages and paradigms to design robust and easily
maintainable systems. I believe that embracing many different languages (and their corresponding communities) is a great
way to expand one's knowledge and understanding of software.  When I'm not working or writing code, I love lifting
weights, skiing, hiking, and gaming. I'm also an amateur triathlete and aspiring writer.

# Contact

I'm always happy to hear from other technology enthusiasts. The best way to reach me is though
