Getting a lot done is important only when we're doing the right things
{{</tagline>}}

All of us would like to increase our productivity, but it’s easy to confuse “doing more” with doing what actually
matters. There are many ways that we can talk about productivity and how we can differentiate useful work from staying
busy. Toil and overhead are terms often used interchangeably to describe necessary but unproductive work, but they
differ significantly in what they demand from us. Likewise, balancing efficiency and effectiveness is essential to
getting valuable work done without sacrificing the flexibility that allows teams to adapt and innovate. Understanding
these dynamics will make teams not only more productive, but also more impactful.

# Toil vs. Overhead

| Aspect            | Toil                                         | Overhead                                                            |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Nature**        | Repetitive, operational, automatable         | Administrative, process-oriented                                    |
| **Growth**        | Scales linearly with service size            | Tends to be constant, some economies of scale                       |
| **Value**         | No cumulative value, non-innovative          | Indirect value, may provide coordination benefits                   |
| **Eliminability** | Can often be automated away                  | Often structural, elimination may impact coordination or compliance |
| **Goal**          | Reduce through automation                    | Streamline, minimize where possible                                 |

# Effective vs. Efficient

| Aspect                   | Effectiveness                                      | Efficiency                                           |
|----------------------    |----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**                | Doing the *right* things                           | Doing things *right*                                 |
| **Slack's Role**         | Requires slack for flexibility and problem-solving | Often sees slack as waste                            |
| **Impact on Innovation** | Enables innovation and problem-solving             | May limit innovation, focusing on routine            |
| **Resilience**           | Higher, due to capacity for unplanned work         | Lower, as high efficiency reduces flexibility        |
| **Goal**                 | Maximizing impact and adaptability                 | Minimizing resource consumption, increasing delivery |

The focus is often on maximizing efficiency, but more often we'd be better served by focusing on making our teams more
effective. Getting a lot done is important only when we're doing the right things. This is a large part of why it's
important to[measuring outcomes over outputs](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/OutcomeOverOutput.html). While it's true
that measuring outcomes is, in general, much more difficult than measuring the outputs of a given team, it's really
the act of _attempting_ to measure the outcome that is as important as anything else. Teams should be focused on the
outcomes that they're achieving rather than thinking myopically about the number of features that they've delivered or
story points that they've closed in each sprint. The mindset rather than the perfection of the measurement is the goal.
