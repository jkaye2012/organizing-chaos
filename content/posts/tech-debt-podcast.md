I recently joined [a podcast](https://creators.spotify.com/pod/show/thetechtrek/episodes/Tech-Debt-and-Conscious-Decision-Making-e2r0gdl)
discussing technical debt, conscious decision making, and how engineering leaders can use some of these concepts to help improve
their teams.

This was my first time speaking on a podcast, and it was a lot of fun. Writing remains where I plan to spend most of my time, but it was
great to have the opportunity to discuss these ideas in a different medium.

Give it a listen and let me know what you think. I hope you enjoy!
