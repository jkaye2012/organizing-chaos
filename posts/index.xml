      <description>Engineering teams can often improve their long-term development velocity by slowing down in the short term   A shared misunderstanding Technical debt is an often debated topic. Like most concepts in software, it isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly difficult to find arguments supporting opposite sides of the spectrum - in a single minute of searching I was able to find that some believe that technical debt doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, while others feel that technical debt is the most important aspect of product development.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the inaugural post of Organizing Chaos!
 I&amp;#39;m the type of person who loves to tinker with new pieces of technology. Recently, I&amp;#39;ve been experimenting with a few different technical ideas that I thought were worth writing about (stay tuned for future posts ðŸ˜‰), so naturally I started to get excited about the prospect of setting up a personal development blog for myself.
